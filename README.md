***DISCLAIMER: FLIF development has stopped since FLIF is superceded by FUIF and then again by [JPEG XL](https://jpeg.org/jpegxl/index.html), which is based on a combination of Pik and FUIF. A royalty-free and open source reference implementation of JPEG XL is available on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/wg1/jpeg-xl).***
